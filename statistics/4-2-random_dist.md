[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

> > The numbers generated by random.random are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability.
> > #####Task: Generate 1000 numbers from random.random and plot their PMF and CDF. Is the distribution uniform?

```{python}
#==============================================================================
# # LOAD FILEs
#==============================================================================
#import numpy as np

import pandas as pd
import random

X = pd.DataFrame([random.random() for x in range(1000)], columns= ['randN'])
#X.hist()

#Xs= pd.Series(X.randN)
#pmf = Xs.value_counts().sort_index() / len(Xs)
#pmf.plot.bar(alpha=0.5, color='w', xticks=np.arange(0,1,0.05))

```

< < The probability mass function (PMF), which maps from each value to its probability. A probability is a frequency expressed as a fraction of the sample size, n. To get from frequencies to probabilities, we divide through by n, which is called normalization. PMFs work well if the number of values is small. But as the number of values increases, the probability associated with each value gets smaller and the effect of random noise increases.


```{python}
import thinkstats2

rand_pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(X.randN, label='1000 random values')

import thinkplot
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

thinkplot.Pmf(rand_pmf)
plt.xlabel('Values')
plt.ylabel('PMF')
plt.title('PMF of 1,000 Random Values Between 0 and 1')
plt.savefig(fpath+'figs/ch4ex2_pmf.png')
plt.show()


> > The cumulative distribution function (CDF) is the function that maps from a value to its percentile rank.

```{python}
#import thinkstats2

rand_cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(X.randN, label='1000 random values')

#import thinkplot
#import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

thinkplot.Cdf(rand_cdf)
plt.ylabel('CDF')
plt.xlabel('Values')
plt.title('CDF of 1,000 Random Values Between 0 and 1')
plt.savefig(fpath+'figs/ch4ex2_cdf.png')
plt.show()

```

> >The CDF approximates a straight line, which means that the distribution is uniform.
